## Development of a PDF-Based Question-Answering Chatbot Using LangChain

### AIM:
To design and implement a question-answering chatbot capable of processing and extracting information from a provided PDF document using LangChain, and to evaluate its effectiveness by testing its responses to diverse queries derived from the document's content.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:

In many cases, users need specific information from large documents without manually searching through them. A question-answering chatbot can address this problem by:

1. Parsing and indexing the content of a PDF document.
2. Allowing users to ask questions in natural language.
3. Providing concise and accurate answers based on the content of the document.
  
The implementation will evaluate the chatbotâ€™s ability to handle diverse queries and deliver accurate responses.

### DESIGN STEPS:

#### STEP 1: Load and Parse PDF
Use LangChain's DocumentLoader to extract text from a PDF document.

#### STEP 2: Create a Vector Store
Convert the text into vector embeddings using a language model, enabling semantic search.

#### STEP 3: Initialize the LangChain QA Pipeline
Use LangChain's RetrievalQA to connect the vector store with a language model for answering questions.

#### STEP 4: Handle User Queries
Process user queries, retrieve relevant document sections, and generate responses.

#### STEP 5: Evaluate Effectiveness
Test the chatbot with a variety of queries to assess accuracy and reliability.
